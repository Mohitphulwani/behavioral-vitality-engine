A Cloud-Native Market Intelligence Engine using Bayesian Decay and K-Means to predict customer vitality ($P-Alive$) and reclaim $287K in at-risk revenue.
🚀 Behavioral Vitality Engine: Stochastic Revenue Recovery
Quantifying Brand Memory Decay & Reclaiming $287,137 in At-Risk Portfolio Value📌 Project Executive SummaryTraditional e-commerce analytics often fail by treating customer loss as a binary, deterministic event. This framework shifts that perspective to a Stochastic Survival Model, hypothesizing that customer engagement is a Latent State (Vitality) driven by Habit Strength (Frequency) and Temporal Decay (Recency).By analyzing a 2.5 million user portfolio via Google BigQuery and Python, this project identifies a 700-day "Psychological Cliff" where brand recall collapses and prescribes an automated roadmap to reclaim $287,137 in annual revenue through targeted "Causal Nudges."🧪 Methodology & The "Science"1. Latent State Estimation ($P-Alive$)Moving beyond standard RFM, I developed a Stochastic Vitality Score using an exponential decay function:The Decay Constant ($\lambda = 0.05$): Models the rate at which a customer’s probability of being "active" fades over time.The 700-Day Cliff: Modeling revealed that brand memory fades to near zero after ~700 days of inactivity, regardless of historical monetary value.Habitual Resistance: The model weights total order frequency as "Vitality Armor"—higher purchase counts increase a customer's resilience to time-based decay.2. High-Dimensional Clustering (K-Means)Using Scikit-Learn, I performed K-Means clustering on behavioral vectors to segment the portfolio based on current health vs. historical economic value:Champions (31.22% Revenue Core): High Vitality / High Value. Strategy: Protection via Loyalty Rewards.At-Risk VIPs: Low Vitality / High Value. Strategy: Urgent Rescue via High-Incentive Win-Backs.New Potentials: High Vitality / Low Value. Strategy: Habit Formation.Hibernating (26.25% Revenue Share): Zero Vitality. Strategy: Deprioritize to maximize marketing profit margins.3. Prescriptive Choice ArchitectureThe engine moves from descriptive to Prescriptive Analytics. Each user is programmatically assigned a "Nudge" (e.g., High-Incentive Win-Back, Loyalty Early Access) based on their specific cluster and decay stage, transforming raw data into an operational $287K recovery roadmap.🛠️ The Technical StackData Engineering: Google BigQuery (SQL) using Window Functions for high-performance event sequencing.Modeling: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn) for latent state estimation and clustering.BI & UI: Tableau Executive Command Center featuring a dynamic "Save-List" and "Urgency Slider."📊 Data Schema (customer_gold_record)FieldTypeDescriptionuser_idSTRINGPrimary Key (2.5M Users)p_aliveFLOATVitality Score: 0.0–1.0 latent probability of engagementtotal_revenueFLOATLifetime historical spendrecency_daysINTDays since last transaction (The Decay Metric)total_ordersINTPurchase count (The Habit Metric)persona_clusterSTRINGK-Means derived segment (e.g., At-Risk VIP)recommended_nudgeSTRINGAutomated prescriptive intervention assignedretention_priorityFLOATPercentile Rank (0-1) for resource allocation📈 Key Strategic InsightsRevenue Anchor: 31.22% of total revenue is anchored in the Champion segment. The strategy shifts from acquisition-heavy spend to Core Protection.Diagnostic Warning: 26.25% of historical revenue is currently "Hibernating," quantifying the total financial loss of past inaction.Strategic Lift: Targeted interventions for At-Risk VIPs yield a projected $287,137 annual revenue recovery.📂 Repository StructurePlaintext├── sql/
